# Policy Against Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)

### Effective Date: 21 Jan 2025.

Overview: xvii is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for all users. We take a strong stance against child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) in any form. This policy outlines our commitment to preventing, reporting, and addressing CSAE, as well as our procedures for handling media material that may violate these standards.

This policy applies to all users of xvii and covers all forms of communication, including text, images, videos, and any other type of media shared through the app.

## 1. Zero Tolerance Policy on CSAE

xvii strictly prohibits the creation, distribution, or facilitation of any content involving child sexual abuse or exploitation. Any attempt to use the app to share or solicit such content will result in immediate action, including:

 - Account Suspension or Termination: Any user found violating this policy will have their account suspended or permanently banned.
 - Immediate Reporting: We will report any instances of CSAE directly to the relevant law enforcement agencies and authorities as required by law.

## 2. User Responsibility and Awareness

Users of xvii are required to adhere to all relevant local, national, and international laws regarding CSAE. By using the app, users agree to:

 - Not upload, share, or distribute any media that depicts or promotes CSAE.
 - Immediately report any content that they believe may involve CSAE to the appropriate authorities and to the app developer.

## 3. Reporting CSAE Content

If you encounter any media within xvii that you suspect may involve CSAE, you are encouraged to report it. There are two ways to do so:

 - Report Directly to the Social Network Owner: Since xvii serves as a mobile client for VK, any media content can be flagged and reported to the social network owner through their reporting features or tools. The social network is responsible for taking appropriate actions in line with their policies.

## 4. Handling Reports and Investigations

Once a report is made:

 - Investigation: The reported content will be reviewed by the app team (or a designated third party) to determine whether it violates the CSAE policy.
 - Cooperation with Authorities: If the content is confirmed to involve CSAE, I will cooperate with law enforcement agencies and provide any necessary information to help with the investigation.
 - Content Removal: If the content is deemed to be in violation of this policy, it will be immediately removed from the app, and the user's account may be terminated, depending on the severity of the violation.

## 5. No Data Retention and Limited User Interaction

As a mobile client app, xvii does not store, retain, or have access to the content that users send or receive. The app functions purely as a communication platform and does not hold or process user data. Our only role is to facilitate the interaction between users and the connected social network. This means:

 - No Direct Access to Media: xvii does not host or retain media material, such as images or videos, shared through the app.
 - Limited Data Collection: We collect minimal user information solely for the purpose of providing the appâ€™s functionality (e.g., device information, app usage analytics, etc.) and do not use this information for any purpose related to CSAE content moderation.

## 6. Compliance with Legal Obligations

We comply with all applicable laws regarding CSAE, including the Protecting Children from Sexual Predators Act, The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and other international regulations concerning child protection and online safety.

## 7. Education and Prevention

While xvii is a communication platform, we encourage users to educate themselves on the risks associated with CSAE and take preventive measures when engaging with others online. Here are some key points for users to consider:

 - Be Cautious with Personal Information: Avoid sharing personal or identifying information with people you do not know.
 - Educate Children and Teens: If you are a parent or guardian, encourage open conversations with children and teens about online safety and the dangers of CSAE.

## 8. Contact Information

If you have any questions, concerns, or reports related to this policy, please do not hesitate to reach out.

 - Social Network Reporting:
   - In-App Reporting: (!) -> [reason] -> report
   - You can also report CSAE content directly to VK using their built-in reporting mechanisms.
 
 - Developer Contact Information:
   - Email: twoeightnine@list.ru

## Conclusion:

At xvii, we are committed to making the app a safe and secure place for all users. We take any violation of CSAE seriously and will take swift and appropriate actions against those who violate this policy. By working together, we can ensure a safe environment for everyone.

## Acknowledgment:

By using xvii, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to comply with this policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please refrain from using the app.
